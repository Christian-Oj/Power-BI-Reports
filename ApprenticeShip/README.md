# Apprenticeship Report

The design for this power-bi report, will be consistent with the design for both **an Analyst and an Information Worker** (based on the audience level as describe by Microsoft *[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-bi-effective-requirements/2-identify)*).

The data used for this report can be found [here](/ApprenticeShip/Apprenticeship%20Data%20Analyst%20Task.xlsx) and the actual report can be found [here](/ApprenticeShip/Apprenticeship%20Report.pbix)

Cards will be used to provide high level insights and Visuals will be grouped by any relevant element to provide more detailed/supporting insights to the finds. The report can also be filtered by - **School, Learning Aim, Fee Status, and Enrolment Date**

Metrics requested by the Interviewers are as follows:
- The proportion of learners who are continuing their course
- The proportion of learners who have withdrawn from their course.
- The proportion of learners who are currently on a Break in Learning.
- The proportion of learners who are continuing their course but have exceeded their planned end date.
